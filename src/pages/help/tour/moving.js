        <b>The Hotel Navigator</b><br />
        At the bottom of your screen you will see a mini hotel - this is the
        Hotel Navigator. Click on it to open it up. One tab shows you all the
        public spaces you can go to - the clubs, caf√©s, swimming pools etc.
        The other tab is where you'll find the guest rooms - rooms other Habbos
        have made themselves.

        <b>Moving around a room</b><br />
        It's easy to move inside a room - just click on a square to walk to it.
        If your feet need a rest, click on or under beds and chairs to sit or
        lie down. And if you fancy a boogie, click on your Habbo and then click
        the 'dance' button that appears on the right hand side of the screen.

        <b>Chatting</b><br />
        If you want to say something, type in the box at the bottom of the screen
        and hit the return key. Only the people near you will hear - Habbos futher
        away will see dots in your speech bubble - so choose 'shout' to let the
        whole room know your thoughts. If you want to whisper something secret to
        another Habbo, choose 'whisper' and click on them before you hit return.

        Met someone you like? Click on them and click 'Ask to be a Friend' and a
        Friend Request will be sent to their <Link to="/help/safety/console">Habbo Console.</Link> That's 
        the yellow icon next to the Hotel Navigator. If they accept your request,
        they'll be added to your Friends List.
