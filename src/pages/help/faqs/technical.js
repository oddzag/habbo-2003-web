          <h5><div id="2">Why do I get the alert 'Out of memory'?</div></h5>
          When loading Habbo Hotel - or afterwards - you may get an alert saying "Out of memory even 
          after purging all cast members ..". Habbo Hotel has loads of graphics that consume your 
          computer memory (RAM) and the alert means that there is not enough free memory for Habbo to work.
          <br /><br />
          In many cases, the following tricks help:
          <br /><br />
          a) close your browser and other applications (such as word processor, spreadsheet, mp3-player). 
          Now open your browser and try Habbo Hotel again.
          <br /><br />
          b) restart the computer. Often, when your computer has been in use for long periods, its memory 
          gets full.
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="3">Why do I only see a black page and a Shockwave logo?</div></h5>
          This means that there is something wrong with your Shockave download. Click the link below to 
          reinstall it: http://sdc.shockwave.com/shockwave/download/frameset.fhtml
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="4">Why do I keep getting the 'Disconnected' notice?</div></h5>
          You keep seeing the 'disconnected' message - this means that the connection between your
          computer and the hotel servers has broken. Sometimes you might be able to speak or move
          about, but some parts of the hotel may not work - like your Navigator or Console. Try
          reloading the hotel (F5 or Ctrl-R). If you constantly get disconnected it might be an
          idea to change your ISP (eg AOL, Freeserve).
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="5">I use Linux, why can I not download Habbo Hotel?</div></h5>
          Sorry, but Habbo Hotel is made with Shockwave Director and there is no Director plugin for
          Linux. The reason Habbo Hotel is made with Shockwave Director is that this provides the best
          user experience over a standard Internet connection.
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="6">Why can't I see the whole screen when I use AOL?</div></h5>
          The default browser supplied with an AOL connection does not display Habbo Hotel correctly.
          You can still use AOL to connect - simply choose a different browser, such as Internet
          Explorer or Netscape.
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="7">Why can't I see where to talk?</div></h5>
          If you are not using AOL (see FAQ on AOL if you are), then try pressing Ctrl-R (Apple-R on a Mac),
          which should reload the hotel in a browser window with scroll bars. To avoid this
          problem set your browser so that the windows are not cascading - ie not getting 
          further down the screen each time you open a new one.
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="8">Can I get a computer virus from Habbo Hotel?</div></h5>
          No - there is no way that we know of that a virus could get on to Habbo Hotel's
          servers and from there on to our members' computers.
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="9">Why is my speech taking a while to appear on the screen?</div></h5>
          If there is a time lag between you typing and your speech appearing on-screen, 
          it is most probably because either the hotel is either very busy or internet traffic 
          is very busy today.
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="10">Why can't I get into a room?</div></h5>
          It may be full - check the Hotel Navigator to see how many people are in it first. 
          Public rooms can hold 40 people and private rooms, 25. People move about a lot in the 
          hotel though, so try again in a minute or two.
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="11">Why do I get a pop-up a 'security risk' when I load Habbo Hotel?</div></h5>
          This looks scary, but it's just the standard pop up from Shockwave. Just tick the third 
          box and it won't appear again.
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="12">Why do I get a message saying so-and-so file is not a Director file?</div></h5>
          This is most likely caused by the Internet connection between your browser and Habbo 
          Hotel breaking during the downloading of the file referred to in the error message.
          <br /><br />
          This should solve the problem:
          1) Close all Internet Explorer (IE) windows 2) Open a new IE window 3) Choose "Internet 
          Options" in the "Tools" menu on the top menu bar 4)Choose "Temporary Internet Files" in 
          the window that opens 5) Click on the button labelled "Delete Files..." 6) Click on "OK" 
          to empty the locally cached files 7) Close the IE window
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="13">Why can't I see anyone / see a black screen?</div></h5>
          The main cause for invisible habbos, invisible clothing, missing catalogues or consoles 
          are that your shockwave files are missing and need to be re-downloaded. You can do this 
          by following these steps: 1) Close all Internet Explorer (IE) windows 2) Open a new IE 
          window 3) Choose "Internet Options" in the "Tools" menu on the top menu bar 4)Choose 
          "Temporary Internet Files" in the window that opens 5) Click on the button labelled 
          "Delete Files..." 6) Click on "OK" to empty the locally cached files 7) Close the IE window
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="14">Why does it say old client please reload?</div></h5>
          We are constantly working to make Habbo Hotel run faster for you and have cool new stuff. 
          This means that we have to change the whole client (the graphics you download to your 
          machine to show you the hotel). Try pressing CTRL + R to download (Apple + R on a Mac) 
          and if it still doesn't help try the following: This should solve the problem: 1) Close 
          all Internet Explorer (IE) windows 2) Open a new IE window 3) Choose "Internet Options" 
          in the "Tools" menu on the top menu bar 4)Choose "Temporary Internet Files" in the window 
          that opens 5) Click on the button labelled "Delete Files..." 6) Click on "OK" to empty the 
          locally cached files 7) Close the IE window
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="15">Why are some of the things in my hand/room grey/white boxes with PH written on them?</div></h5>
          PH = place holder. These boxes show when Shockwave (the programme used for Habbo graphics)
          cannot display what you have in our database. This could be for all kind sof technical reasons, 
          such as your machine being low on memory, one of Habbo's machines being low on memory or even 
          it could be the internet is very busy. To fix this - just reload and all your furni should show 
          in its full glory. The boxes show that all your things are safe.
          <div class="content_ruler"></div>
          <h5><div id="16">Why is Habbo Hotel so slow to load?</div></h5>
          This mostly happens with dial-up connections to the Internet and is caused by the Internet 
          being too busy. The easiest way to avoid this and make sure that Habbo Hotel runs as smoothly 
          as possible is to connect to the Internet by Broadband which is a much faster connection. If 
          you are in the UK, you can find out more about BT Broadband by clicking here

          <h5><div id="21">How do I get rid of a keylogger?</div></h5>
          A keylogger is a virus sent by a file to your computer. If you have opened that file, it is 
          possible that you have a keylogger on your machine. A keylogger records every key stroke and 
          therefore the person that sent it to you has access to your passwords, credit card numbers and 
          even conversations. There is no general way to get rid of keyloggers. When it comes to tackling 
          them, it largely depends on what anti-virus software you have on your computer. Many people have 
          Norton software for example. If you go to the Norton website or the main website of your anti-virus 
          software, you should be able to find on there instructions on how to get rid of the keylogger. 
          It is very important that you do this.
