            <h5><div id="1">How do I buy Habbo Credits if I am not in the UK?</div></h5>
            You can either use a credit card or send in a cheque or postal order in
            US dollars, Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, pounds sterling or euros.
            Please do not send cash under any circumstances. We also have phone lines
            for the countries with the most Habbos in them - you can call them from
            your home phone.
            <br /><br />
            For more information, please look in your Habbo Purse (at the bottom of the
            screen when you have checked into the hotel).
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="2">Why can't Habbo Credits be free?</div></h5>
            Habbo Hotel is available to anyone over the Internet. Visiting the hotel is
            free - unlike other services that provide the kind of experience we do, you
            don't have to buy a CDROM or pay a monthly subscription fee. We only charge
            for 'extras', such as furniture and mobile phone logos, and we have priced
            these at an affordable level for everyone - anyone can have a digital TV in
            the Habbo Hotel! You are welcome at the Hotel, whether you buy Credits or not.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="3">How do I get Habbo Credits?</div></h5>
            There are many different ways - for example with SMS on your mobile phone,
            Splash Plastic, debit cards and credit cards.
            <br /><br />
            To find out more, please look in your Habbo Purse (at the bottom of the
            screen when you are signed in to the hotel).

            <h5><div id="4">How do I buy Habbo Credits from Canada?</div></h5>
            You can either pay by credit card, or send in a cheque or money order in
            Canadian dollars. We no longer accept Canadian postal orders. Please do not
            send cash under any circumstances. Check out the payment pages linked from
            your Purse for more information
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="5">How do I buy Habbo Credits from the US?</div></h5>
            You can either pay by credit card, or send in a cheque or postal order in
            US dollars. Please do not send cash under any circumstances.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="6">When will credit cards be back up?</div></h5>
            Credit cards are back but at the moment for the USA and Canada only. Habbo
            credits can only be bought with a US Visa, American Express or Discover
            credit card or a Canadian Visa, Discover or American Express card.
            Mastercard will also be able to be used in a few weeks. It is a different
            credit card system from what we used before. Please go to the purchase page
            and follow the instructions. We are trying our best to get more countries up soon.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="7">When will the Australian Credits Line be back up?</div></h5>
            There was a fault on the Australian Habbo Credits line. We have taken it
            down in order to fix it but it is taking longer than expected to correct
            the problem. We are working on it right now and are sorry for the delay.
            We will let you know as soon as it is back up.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="8">When will the Canada credits line be back up?</div></h5>
            There was a fault on the Canada Habbo Credits line. We have taken it down
            in order to fix it but it is taking longer than expected to correct the
            problem. We are working on it right now and are sorry for the delay. We
            will let you know as soon as it is back up.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="9">Why can't I buy Credits on Virgin Mobile?</div></h5>
            Our service to buy Habbo Credits with a Virgin Mobile phone is not working
            properly at the moment so we've had to take it down until it is fixed. We
            are working on it but it is taking quite a while to correct the problem.
            Sorry for the delay. We will let you know as soon as it is back up.
