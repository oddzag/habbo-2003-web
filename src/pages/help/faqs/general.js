            <h5><div id="1">What's Habbo Hotel all about?</div></h5>
            Take a <Link to="/help">virtual tour</Link> of Habbo Hotel and find out all about it.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="2">What is the Habbo Way?</div></h5>
            The Habbo Way is like a code of conduct - how Habbos should act in
            the hotel. Habbos who break the Habbo Way are not welcome in the hotel
            and may be banned.
            <br /><br />
            Read about the Habbo Way by <Link to="/help/safety">clicking here</Link>.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="3">What are Habbo Hotel's Terms and Conditions?</div></h5>
            Read Habbo Hotel's full <Link to="/help/safety/terms">Terms and Conditions</Link> here.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="4">Is it OK for me to give out my personal details?</div></h5>
            You should never share your personal details with anyone at Habbo Hotel -
            Habbos may not be who they say they are.
            This is why we have created the Habbo Console - so that you can email and
            SMS without knowing other Habbos' details.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="5">Why do my words come up as 'bobba'?</div></h5>
            All areas of Habbo Hotel have a word filter on them, which filters out
            offensive words. This covers swearing, and racist or sexist language.
            Offensive words are replaced with 'bobba'. The Bobba Filters also work on
            Habbo names, missions, Stickies and all types of messages sent through the
            Console.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="6">I've been 'hacked' - what should I do?</div></h5>
            If you've been 'scammed' or 'hacked' and can't sign in as your Habbo,
            please email the Guest Services Centre using the special 'Help! I've been
            scammed' form.
            <br /><br />
            Please do not send an email to us from the Guest Services Centre
            (where you are now). <Link to="/help/scam/scammed">'Help! I've been scammed!'</Link> reports are looked
            into first, so it makes sense to use the Scam Busters form. :)
            <br /><br />

            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="7">How do I chat?</div></h5>
            When you are in a room, type into the box at the bottom of the screen.
            Then press the return key (or 'enter') to speak. If you want to whisper
            to your friend or shout, select it from the pop-up menu on the left. If
            you are whispering, make sure you click on your Habbo friend too, or they
            won't be able to hear you.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="8">Why can't I hear what people say?</div></h5>
            If you can't hear other people talking, it is probably because you are
            not close enough! You can only hear people who are in radius of five
            squares from you. This way, you can have a quiet conversation with your
            friends. But if you shout, everyone will hear you.
            <br /><br />
            Sometimes you see chat bubbles with words replaced by dots. This means
            you hear only partially what other people are saying.
            <br /><br />
            To shout, so that everyone in the room can hear you, choose 'shout' from
            the pop up menu next to the box where you type.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="9">How do I change the way I look?</div></h5>
            Changing your appearance is easy! Simply, click on 'Update your Habbo ID'
            at the bottom left of the screen.
            <br /><br />
            You'll got straight to the page where you can change your looks. Choose
            your new look and click 'done', or click 'next' to change your personal
            details (email address etc).
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="10">How do I get a costume in the Cinema?</div></h5>
            To put on a costume you need to click on the first square of the tunnel
            that leads to the big screen. Then the costume box will pop up.
            <br /><br />
            Choose your costume or keep your own clothes and then you'll automatically
            go on stage.
            <br /><br />
            Please note: you will look exactly like the picture of the Habbo wearing
            the costume - you may change into a boy if you were a girl or vice versa.
            but don't panic - you'll get your normal clothes back when you come off stage!
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="11">How do I walk, sit and lay down?</div></h5>
            To walk around, click on the floor tile you want to move to and wait. Your
            Habbo will walk over to it. To sit or lay down, click on the floor tile
            underneath the seat or bed you want to sit or lie on.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="12">How do I dance?</div></h5>
            To dance, click on yourself and the dance button will appear under your
            Habbo on the right-hand side of the screen. Click on the button to get
            grooving, click it again to stop.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="13">Why have I been returned to the Hotel View page?</div></h5>
            This is probably because you have been inactive for a while. If you do not
            move for five minutes your Habbo's eyes close, so that people know that you
            are not active.
            <br /><br />
            After 15 minutes you are automatically returned to the Hotel View page.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="14">Why can't I make a new Habbo?</div></h5>
            If you are making a new Habbo and the alert 'Wrong Password' appears,
            this actually means that you have used a character that is not allowed.
            <br /><br />
            This is a list of the characters you can use in a Habbo name:
            <br /><br />
            abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789-=?!@:.,
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="15">Can I work in one of the public spaces?</div></h5>
            Sorry, but all of the hotel's public spaces are fully staffed right now.
            Also, Eric, Sadie, Piers and all the other Hotel Staff work for free,
            without lunch breaks or pay, so it's not much fun anyway!
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="16">How can I change my Habbo's name?</div></h5>
            Sorry, we currently cannot do this due to technical issues! Try signing
            up for a new habbo in the meantime.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="17">Am I allowed to use a special program to alter things in the hotel?</div></h5>
            No, because these programs change the code that is sent from your computer
            to the Habbo Hotel servers. This is expressly forbidden in our <Link to="/help/safety/terms">Terms and Conditions</Link> Any 
            Habbo using such programs will be banned permanently and
            his/her details may be passed on to the police.
            <br /><br />
            This applies to any changes you make to your Habbo character, to guest
            rooms and to items of furniture.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="18">How do I change my password?</div></h5>
            Just click on 'Update my Habbo ID' - then you can change your password
            easily. NEVER change your password to something someone has told you to.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="19">Who are Hobbas?</div></h5>
            Hobbas are Habbo Hotel's volunteer moderators. All of the current Hobbas
            names are here (in alphabetical order). We update this regularly. If
            someone tells you they are a Hobba and their name is not on this list,
            they are not telling the truth.

            All Hobbas have badges with stars on them (silver and gold). If you can't
            see the badge, it means they're off duty.<br />
            To learn more about Hobbas, please read <Link to="/help/safety/mods">About Hobbas</Link>.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="20">How old must a Hobba be?</div></h5>
            All Hobbas must be 18 or older. You may only apply if you are over 18 years
            old. Hobbas have much responsibility and therefore must be of an age to
            handle volunteer moderation. To learn more about Hobbas, please read <Link to="/help/safety/mods">About Hobbas</Link>.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="21">I have written to the Guest Services Centre, why hasn't my email been answered?</div></h5>
            We get hundreds of emails each day so we are not able to answer every
            single one. We do read them all however, and answer as many as possible.
            It will usually take no more than a couple of working days for you to
            get a reply but please bear with us, and be aware that you probably will
            not get an immediate reply.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="22">How do I type hearts?</div></h5>
            To type a heart on your PC in Habbo, you need to hold down the Shift key
            and press the \ key. In Habbo, this should give you a little heart symbol.
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h5><div id="23">What should I do if I've been scammed?</div></h5>
            You need to go to <Link to="/help/scam">scambusters</Link> and fill in a scam report. You'll find
            examples of the most common scams near the bottom of the page and also
            the 'Help! I've been scammed!' link. Click on it and fill it out with as
            much detail as posssible so that we can help you.
            </p>
