        <h1>Furni scams</h1>
        <div id="scam_two"></div>
        In real life you look after your possessions don't you? You wouldn't think
        about leaving your prized Gameboy with someone you hardly knew would you?
        And surely you wouldn't dream of doing a swop with someone where you had
        to hand over your things first?
        <br /><br />
        Then why do it in Habbo Hotel? Just because a Habbo is friendly, doesn't
        mean you can trust them. Always use the secure trading system to trade with
        other Habbos and only every put your furni in someone's room if they truly
        are a friend (not someone you met five minutes ago).
        <div class="content_ruler"></div>
        <h3>"I've got a really, really rare item - no one else has got it..."</h3>
        It's true that some items are rarer than others - but don't fall for the
        scammers who have items you've never seen before. Always check this list
        first to see what items of furni are truly rare and which items are illegal:
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Hotel Manager birthday gifts</h3><br />
        These were given out to Habbos who were registered before the Hotel Manager's birthday in 2002. They have never been on sale:
        <br /><br />
        Throne<br />
        Samovar<br />
        Holoboy<br />
        <br />
        <h3>Items in the Catalogue Rares Collection</h3><br />
        These items have all been on sale for 14 days only, at 25 Credits:<br />
        Hologirl - first item in the collection, on sale before Christmas 2002.
        <br /><br />
        Holiday Romance - second item. On sale around Valentine's Day 2003.
        Aloe Vera - current item. Formerly known as Small Plant. On sale until March 31, 2003.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Seasonal items</h3><br />
        These are on sale in the run up to Christmas, Easter, Valentine's Day and
        Halloween. They appear in their own section of the Catalogue and the whole
        section is removed when the holiday is over. So, if any item isn't in the
        Catalogue and isn't in the 'illegal' list below, it's probably a seasonal
        item that will be on sale again at the right time of year.
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Competition prizes</h3><br />
        These items have never been on sale - only competition winners were given them:
        <br /><br />
        Trophies (Bronze, Silver and Gold)<br />
        Typewriters - only given out to Habbos who get a poem or article published in one of the hotel's newsletters.<br />
        Spyro Egg - only given to winners of the Spyro Quest.<br />
        <br />
        <h3>Habbo Club items</h3><br />
        These are only given to members of the Habbo Club:
        <br /><br />
        Green Sofa - month 1<br />
        Sky Blue Plasto set (table and chairs) - month 2<br />
        Mochamaster - month 3<br />
        Dicemaster - month 4<br />
        <br />
        <h3>Illegal or hacked items</h3><br />
        DON'T trade for these items. If they're hacked they may not work
        properly, or we may have to delete them and then you will have lost
        all the furni you traded for them:
        <br /><br />
        Pods of colours not in Catalogue<br />
        Bear rugs of colours not in Catalogue<br />
        Chess board<br />
        Jacuzzi<br />
        Mountain Dew machines<br />
        Broken Gingerbread Houses
        <div class="content_ruler"></div>
        <h3>"Give me 10 HC Sofas for my Sypro egg"</h3>
        OK, so Spyro eggs are rare. But how exactly are you going to give ten items
        in a trade? The box only takes six. One of you will have to click 'accept'
        before the whole trade is finished. Our advice is not to do it - don't trade
        more than six items for anything. If you do and it goes wrong, we can't
        help you get your furni back.
        <div class="content_ruler"></div>
        <h3>"If you give me one piece of furni, I'll give you a job that pays"</h3>
        A job that pays - fantastic! Just think of all the furni you could buy...
        Wake up Habbo! Have you ever heard of a job in real life that you have to
        pay to get? Of course not.
        <br /><br />
        If you give another Habbo a piece of furni for a job, chances are you'll
        work for nothing. Or you might not even get to work at all - often there
        is no job.
        <br /><br />
        This isn't to say that there aren't any jobs in Habbo Hotel. Some Habbos
        do offer jobs in their rooms and these can be fun to do. Just don't expect
        to get paid, even if that's what you're told in the first place.
        <div class="content_ruler"></div>
        <h3>"I can clone your furni - just put it down in my room"</h3>
        Some Habbos claim that they can clone your furni if you put it down in their
        room. Not true! They will just steal it from you.
        <div class="content_ruler"></div>
        <h3>"I'll paint your room for one furni"</h3>
        Other Habbos cannot paint your room or change the floor. The only way to do
        this is by buying wallpaper, paint, carpets etc from the Catalogue.
        <div class="content_ruler"></div>
        <h3>"Race to win furni"</h3>
        There are lots of racing games in the hotel - races where you get food out
        of fridges, races where you rush to stand on a doormat and even 'musical
        chairs' (without the music though!).
        <br /><br />
        These games and races are great fun, but not all the Habbos who run them
        are honest. Don't be surprised if they don't give you a prize when you win.
        Don't take part if you can't trust the Habbo running the room.
