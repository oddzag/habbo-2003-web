            <h1>Phone scams</h1>
            You can buy Habbo Credits by phoning one of the Habbo Credits Lines. Some
            meanie Habbos have worked out a scam on these, but once you've read this
            page, they won't be able to get away with it.<br /><br />
            <div class="content_ruler"></div>
            <h3>"Ring this number and type in this code and you'll get free Habbo Credits"</h3>
            Yet another tempting offer and it sounds so simple. Just dial the number,
            put in the code and - bingo - free Credits in your Purse. But no, this is
            another scam.
            <br /><br />
            You can get Credits by ringing a special landline number, but only if you
            put in your own Habbo Credits Code. You can only find this out by looking
            in your Habbo Purse.
            <br /><br />
            If you fall for this scam, all that you are doing is buying Credits for the
            scammer. The code he or she tells you to use is their Habbo Credits Code.
            The cost of the Credits will come up on your next phone bill.
